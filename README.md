#  K-Means Clustering

For K-Means, we have worked on three projects:

## 1. K_Means_Example.ipynb
	Problem Statement:
	Cluster candidated based on questions rated on them on a scale of 1 to 5( 1=Disagree, 3=Neutral, 5=Agree)
	Questions asked are mentioned in the data description of the Kaggle dataset.(Please refer link below)

	Big Five Personality Test - Removed NaN and 0
	Adapted from https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/big-five-personality-test
	Dataset by: Ramon Tanoeiro

## 2. K_Means_Averaged.ipynb
	Same problem as above, however, we take average of 10 questions for each of the personality types. Did this just for exploration and learning

##3. Satisfaction_Rating.ipynb

	Problem statement: We try to explore the relation between employee satisfaction and rating they get. Dataset used is same as the one used in Logistic regression, however, here we only use 2 columns.
